User story: A user who is not logged in should be able to find concerts for an artist of their choice, whether they specify a location or not.

Description: 
A user who is not logged in can search for an artist's upcoming concerts. They can choose to not specify a location and all of the artist's upcoming concerts will be displayed in a sequential order with concerts happening earlier displayed before concerts happening on a later date. 

If a user decides to include a location and a maximum distance from the location we will limit the results to the concerts that are within the location and display them in the same sequential order as before.

We will include the prices of concerts from various vendors in the concert details. 

A message will be displayed to the user indicating that the artist has no upcoming concerts in the event that a user has no upcoming concerts.
