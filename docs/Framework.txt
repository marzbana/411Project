Our team has chosen to use the MERN stack for the development of our website. 
We have chosen this stack primarily because of its ease of use and scalability. 
We believe it’s perfect to use for our simple website that displays a user’s followed artists from Spotify, and displays data about their upcoming concerts in a user’s area.
The MERN stack is also known for its simplicity and flexibility, which makes it an ideal choice to delve into building a website.
In addition, the MERN stack is well-supported by a large and active community of developers, which means that we’ll have plenty of resources available for learning and troubleshooting issues. 
This makes it a good choice for us to learn new skills and expand our knowledge of web development.
Overall, we believe that the MERN stack is the best choice for our team and for the development of our website. 
We are excited to learn more about these technologies as we continue to work on our project, and we look forward to building a great website.
