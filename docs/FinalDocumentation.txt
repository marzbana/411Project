Our project uses the MERN stack. 
Our two APIs are Spotify and TicketMaster.
We use Spotify Oauth. 

Once you enter our website you are prompted with a login button on the main page. 
When you click login the front end asks the backend for a state which is stored in a cookie to be verrified later.
Then, you are redirected to a spotify login page where you must enter your spotify credentials. 
Once you login you will be redirected to a page on our front end that sends the received code and state to the backend to be verified and logged in our data base.
The backend sends an encrypted user id of the user that is first obtained from a spotify api call. 
Then, we store the user id in a cookie on the users browser.
Once the user is logged in they can access a new home page that has a logout button at the top right and a search button.
If the user wishes to log out they can press the logout button which clears their login cookie and removes their stored tokens from our data base. 
If the user presses on search they will be sent to a page asking them if they want to see their followed artists.
If they click yes they will be sent to a page with their top 10 followed artists from spotify. 
They can then enter a state abbreviation and click on an artist to see upcoming concerts in their state.
We use the TicketMaster API to retrieve the artists upcoming concerts.]
If the artist has any scheduled concerts on an affiliated TicketMaster website they will show up.
If the user wants to go home or back to the artists page they can click the respected buttons.
